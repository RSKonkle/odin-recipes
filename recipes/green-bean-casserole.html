    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, and this version
       can be on the table in no time at all thanks to just four ingredients from your pantry/fridge.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (14.5 oz) cans green breans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 oz) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz) can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps<h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Mix green beans and condensed soup together in a large microwave-safe bowl
            until well combined. Microwave on high until warm, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 cup cheddar cheese into the green bean mixture. Microwave on high
            for 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread evenly over the bottom. Sprinkle
            French-fried onions over top, then sprinkle with remaining cheddar.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the onions are just turning,
            about 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
