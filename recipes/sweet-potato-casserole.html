        <li><strong>Prepare sweet potatoes:</strong> Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water.

        </li>
        <li>Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar,
            milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.

        <li><strong>Make topping:</strong> Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl. 
            Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix.
            Stir in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
