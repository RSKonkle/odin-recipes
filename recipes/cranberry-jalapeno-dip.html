    <p>Cranberry jalapeño dip is a play on the crowd-pleasing classic: 
       pepper jelly and cream cheese. With its vibrant red hue and sweet-tart flavor, 
       this cranberry jalapeño dip is a must-make this holiday season. (Recipe by Patty Catalano)

        <li>1 medium scallion</li>
        <li>1 small jalapeño pepper</li>
        <li>4 sprigs of fresh cilantro (plus more for serving)</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon or lime</li>
        <li>2 cups of fresh or thawed cranberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

    </ul>
    <div class="sub header">Steps</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer 
        (or a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer). Let sit at room temperature 
        until softened.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding each to a food processor fitted with 
            the blade attachment as you complete it: Cut 1 medium scallion crosswise into 
            1-inch pieces. Trim and halve 1 medium jalapeño pepper lengthwise; remove the 
            white ribs and seeds. Pick the leaves from 4 fresh cilantro sprigs until you have 
            1 tablespoon. Juice 1 medium lemon or lime until you have 1 tablespoon.
        </li>
        <li>Add 2 cups cranberries, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. 
            Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, 
            about 10 (1-second) pulses.
        </li>
        <li>Beat the softened cream cheese on medium speed with the paddle attachment until 
            light and creamy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. 
            Transfer to a serving plate or in a 9-inch pie dish and spread into an even layer 
            about 1/4-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a slotted spoon to spoon the cranberry-jalapeño mixture over the cream cheese 
            (reserve any accumulated juices for cocktails or nonalcoholic spritz), and spread 
            into an even layer. Garnish with more chopped cilantro leaves if desired. Serve with 
            cinnamon pita chips.
        </li>
    </ol>
